# Kaggle

A repo for Kaggle notebooks.

#### [Text-to-text Transformers for Movie/TV show title generation from descriptions](https://github.com/Sowmya-Iyer/Kaggle/blob/master/t5-transformer-for-movie-tv-show-title-prediction.ipynb)
- Used datasets from four OTT platforms - Netflix, Amazon Prime, HULU, DisneyPlus
- Fine tuned T5 transformers for generating creative titles from the movie/ show description
- Yet to add rouge score code in the notebook.

#### [Indian Sign Language letter-prediction from hand pose images](https://github.com/Sowmya-Iyer/Kaggle/blob/master/isl-image-classification-using-fastai.ipynb)
- Used a custom made dataset (different skin colors, background and lighting conditions) of ISL alphabets [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sowmyaiyer/isl-image-classification-with-a-background-clutter)
- Used FastAI to implement Image classification using VGG16 and Resnet18
- Achieved 93.9% accuracy using VGG16 and 91.8% accuracy using Resnet18 

#### [Titanic survival rate prediction using Random Forest Classifier](https://github.com/Sowmya-Iyer/Kaggle/blob/master/titanic-survival-prediction.ipynb)
- Used the Kaggle titanic dataset
- Used EDA for intuition about correlation in features
- Random Forest Classifier used to obtain an accuracy of 86.76%
